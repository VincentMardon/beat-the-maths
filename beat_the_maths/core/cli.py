# Future improvements:
# - Implement a scoring system based on speed and accuracy.
# - Consider packaging the application for easier distribution (e.g., PyInstaller).
# - Add more types of problems (e.g., equations, fractions).
# - Implement a loop to allow multiple problems in one session.
# - Save high scores to a file or database.
# - Add sound effects for correct/wrong answers (optional).
# - Improve input validation (handle non-numeric inputs gracefully).
# - Add a help option to explain the game rules and controls.
# - Consider using a GUI library for a more interactive experience (optional).
# - Add unit tests for the problem generation logic.
# - Refactor code into classes if more features are added later.
# - Add localization support for different languages (optional).
# - Implement a leaderboard to track top scores (optional).
# - Add a timer countdown for each question to increase difficulty (optional).
# - Consider using a configuration file for settings (e.g., default difficulty).
# - Add animations or visual effects for a more engaging experience (optional).
# - Implement user profiles to track individual progress (optional).
# - Add a feature to review past problems and solutions (optional).
